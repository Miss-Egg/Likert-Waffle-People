This program creates a waffle chart infographic based on user input or imported data.
The infographic represents different categories of responses (e.g., levels of agreement or satisfaction) with colored icons.

To use this program, the user needs to have a dataset in either Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) format.
The first column of the dataset should contain the answer choices, and each subsequent column should contain
the number of responses for each answer choice. The program will create a separate waffle chart for each column of responses.

When running the program, the user will be prompted to import data.
If the user chooses to import data, they will be asked to specify the file type and file name.
If the user chooses not to import data, they will be asked to manually input the number of responses for each answer choice.

Each waffle chart will be displayed on the screen and saved as a .png file.
The file name will be the title of the figure.
If no title is provided, the file name will be the current date and time.
